# An-improved-firefly-algorithm

The Firefly Algorithm (FA) is a novel metaheuristic algorithm that simulates the social behavior of fireflies and has shown promising performance in many optimization problems. In FA, each firefly can be attracted by other brighter fireflies, resulting in a large number of attractiveness interactions throughout the algorithm execution. However, it has been observed that the high number of attractiveness interactions in FA can lead to oscillations in the search space and increased computational time. To address these issues, an improved version of the algorithm called Neighbor Attraction Firefly Algorithm (NaFA) has been introduced. This paper proposes a novel reduction process for the step factor parameter to achieve a better balance between exploration and exploitation in NaFA. The proposed algorithm, named Improved Neighbor Attraction Firefly Algorithm (INaFA), is evaluated using several well-known benchmark functions. The experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to the other benchmark algorithms.
